# BJCP-style-dashboard

Description:

A simple excel dashboard based on BJCP 2015 style guidelines


Motivation:

When I'm planning a homebrew recipe, it helps to have the key quantitative
features of the beer style ready to hand. The BJCP style guidelines (available
here: https://www.bjcp.org/docs/2015_Guidelines_Beer.pdf) include that information,
but not in a quickly accessible, easily digested format. This excel dashboard 
displays key data--OG, FG, IBU, and so on--in simple charts and graphs so you don't
need to skim through all 93 pages of the style guide to find what you need.


Instructions:

Using the dashboard is pretty straightforward: on the left, just click on
the beer style in which you're interested. The charts and graphs to the right
will automatically update to show the characteristics for that style.
